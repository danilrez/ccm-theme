### 2.3.0

- Added the new **Flux Dawn** light theme, a warm and energetic theme with a vibrant orange primary, and refined its daylight syntax colors.
- Refreshed docs to list the full four-theme lineup and prepared a new preview for Dawn.

### 2.2.5

- Introduced palette-specific workbench overrides with the new `Flux Twilight` variant, renaming night overrides and deepening selection and drag backgrounds for better contrast in dark themes.
- Tweaked dark palette neutrals to slightly darken selections and highlight backgrounds for consistent contrast across Night and Twilight.

### 2.2.3

- Added a night palette and applied it across the generated themes.
- Renamed themes and refreshed docs; the README preview is now a higher-quality PNG.

### 2.2.2

- Rebuilt every dark accent ramp (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, violet, orange) with the brighter high-saturation HSLA values we already use in the light palette, so diagnostics, Git badges, and other accents now share the same brand hues instead of muted stand-ins.

### 2.2.1

- Hotfix: adjusted Git decorations to remove subtle clashes between staged and unstaged indicators.

### 2.2.0

- Harmonized dark palette values and refreshed status bar contrast, especially for folderless sessions.
- Migrated workbench colors to the flexible `[dark, light]` token format and tuned highlights across editor, activity bar, panels, and more.
- Introduced primary/secondary brand aliases with override support and regression tests, plus reorganized notification customizations.
- Simplified CLI theme generation by inlining brand overrides and removing redundant shade defaults.

### 2.1.0

- Added `Flux Daylight` light theme powered by the new HSL palette engine.
- Introduced `Flux Night (no tokens)` and `Flux Daylight (no tokens)` variants that reuse VS Code's `Default Dark Modern` and `Default Light Modern` syntax tokens.
- Added CLI support for `--no-tokens` along with new generation and test scripts for every theme flavor.
- Swapped hard-coded HEX tables for dynamic HSL palettes to keep colors consistent and easier to maintain.
- Refreshed documentation and assets (including compressed previews) for the expanded lineup.
